<a id="About"></a>
## üí° About the project
> This project involves creating a C program that redirects the output of one process to the input of another process using pipes. The goal of the project is to create a program that is capable of executing two commands (e.g., cat and grep) and redirecting the output of the first command as input to the second command using pipes. The program should be able to read a file and execute the commands specified in it.
